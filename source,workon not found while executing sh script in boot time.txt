#fix source 
#source or . can be used with bash 
#but only . works with sh
replace 'source' with '.' in launcher.sh script

#fix workon
#NOTE:
#virtualenv is a apt-package which actually handles the virtualenviorments 
#virtualenvwrapper is also apt-package but more abstract version of virtualenv.
#which is wrapper-package of virtualenv and it handls virtualenviorments at a abstration level
#####

becoz of some reason we cant use workon on boot-time thatswhy we have to activate a perticular-env with 
virtualenv's script activate which resides in perticular enviorment's directory: /home/usr_name/.virtualencs/my_env/bin/activate
#activate is script
#activate env with command: "source /path/to/my_env/activate"
#example: source /home/pi/.virtualencs/picamera-env/bin


#activate your_env with these commands:
workon your-env
#to find the directory to your_virtualenviorment
cdvirtualenv picamera-env

#move to bin 
cd bin

# copy this directory and paste it to a new terminal 
#NOTE:(it should not have any virtualenv activated)

#and then enter command:
. activate 

# and it will activate the virtualenviorment who's directory you are currently in
